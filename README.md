# Audio Maze
### By Santiago Benoit
Audio Maze is a game that can be played by the sighted and the blind alike. In this game, the player is tasked with navigating a maze and reaching the finish, using only sound. This game features many pre-made mazes as well as a maze editor.

## How to play
As you navigate the maze, you can roll marbles and determine how far away different items or walls are, as well as what the item is, judging by how long the marble has rolled before stopping, how far away it sounds, and what sound it makes when it hits the item. Use this to build a mental map of the layout of the maze relative to your position. Practicing this game could benefit memory and spacial awareness.

## Controls
- W/up arrow: move forward
- S/down arrow: move backward
- A/left arrow: rotate left
- D/right arrow: rotate right

## Game Settings

- Hardcore mode: you die if you touch a wall and must restart the maze.

## Maze Editor
In the Maze Editor, you may create or edit mazes. Here is the list of items you may place in your maze:
- Floor: a standard tile that the player may traverse.
- Wall: an impassable obstacle.
- Door: must be unlocked with a key in order to pass through.
- Key: used for unlocking doors.
- Water: you may walk through this, but marbles will sink and not pass through.
- Start: the player's starting position. The player always starts facing up.
- Finish: the goal for the player to reach in order to win.
